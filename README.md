This project focuses on visualizing land cover transitions over time using alluvial diagrams. 
The primary objective is to illustrate changes between different land cover classes—specifically 
"Forest," "Savanna," and "Other"—across two distinct periods: 2002 to 2013 and 2013 to 2023. 
The visualizations are generated using R, leveraging packages such as `ggplot2` and `ggalluvial`.

Ensure that the paths to the data file and font files are correctly specified. The generated plots will be saved as `All1.jpeg` and `All2.jpeg` in your working
